# Compressed Sensing Image Recovery
## INTRODUCTION
Given a corrupted image with missing pixels, this project exploits the [sparsity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) in natural images to generate a prediction of the original image with the missing pixels filled in, or "recovered". Specifically, this is a signal processing technique known as [compressed sensing image reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing).

### Built With
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
- [SciKitLearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## DEMO
To first give an example of the project's capabilities before going more in depth into the methodology, our given test image of a fishing boat is 192x200 pixels.
